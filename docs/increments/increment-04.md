# WordJotter Project Increment 4: What I've Accomplished

As finding a free Finnish API is not easy, I'll add a button that opens RedFox Dictionary in the device's browser, allowing users to see comprehensive definitions. When they return to the app, they can add their own notes and save the word.

## Strategic Pivot for Dictionary Implementation

- Reassessed the Finnish dictionary integration approach
- Pivoted from direct API integration to leveraging existing external resources
- Maintained project's core purpose as a personal vocabulary learning tool
- Received and analyzed midterm project feedback

## Finnish Language Integration Approach

- Decided to implement RedFox Dictionary integration via external browser for Finnish word lookups
- Planned approach to maintain current Free Dictionary API for English words
- Designed workflow to allow users to return to app and add personal notes after external lookups
- Established consistent cross-language pattern for dictionary lookups

## Educational Benefits Enhancement

- Refocused app to strengthen its core educational value
- Emphasized active learning through personal annotation rather than passive definition reading
- Designed for deeper vocabulary retention through user engagement
- Made app more practical as a bilingual learning assistant

## Technical Implementation Planning

- Outlined approach for using Expo's WebBrowser API to handle external dictionary access
- Planned modifications to SearchScreen to include language-specific dictionary sources
- Developed strategy for database storage of user-added notes and word categorization
- Ensured offline access to saved vocabulary

## Project Scope Refinement

- Simplified development requirements while maintaining educational quality
- Enhanced feasibility within course timeframe constraints
- Maintained focus on key project objectives: bilingual vocabulary learning support
- Preserved all core functionality: saving words, adding notes, categorizing vocabulary, and review

## Next Steps for WordJotter

- Implement WebBrowser integration for Finnish dictionary lookup
- Modify SearchScreen to handle both language workflows
- Create interface for adding personal notes after external lookups
- Enhance MyWordsScreen to display user notes prominently
- Add Text-to-Speech features for pronunciation support
- Create Flashcard Learning Mode for vocabulary practice
